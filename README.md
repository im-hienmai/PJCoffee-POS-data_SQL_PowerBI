### Store 2

## Inconlusion

At Store 1, the potential for "Services" is enormous but remains untapped. The service events typically take place from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, followed by 4:00 PM.

At Store 2, Saigon Coffee Academy has the potential to increase revenue, as learners mostly visit at 1:00 PM or 3:00 PM.

### Insight 
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Customers show reluctance to actively engage with PJ's Coffee's social media unless prompted to do so, and they are hesitant to try new dishes from a menu that is too diverse.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Solutions

1. Streamline the menu by removing unsold or overstocked products. Suggest the menu based on best-selling and must-try items.
2. Increase interaction with PJ's Coffee's social media accounts through check-in or check-in standee programs at the store.
3. Modify combo combinations to include a mix of both best-selling and non-best-selling items to stimulate consumption and boost sales. Consider changing the combination periodically to provide customers with updated options.
4. Incorporate brief information about New Orleans on the packaging to promote the brand. Explore the option of selling PJ's Coffee's traditional coffee in cans or bottles to encourage customers to try it.
